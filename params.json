{"name":"Ircbot","tagline":"mernisse dev branch of ircbot","body":"A small IRC robot in Python based on Twisted Words.\r\nThe default modules currently support the following commands:\r\n###Brain Commands\r\nGet/Set/Delete settings used by other plugins\r\n* botname: set variable value\r\n* botname: get variable\r\n* botname: del variable\r\n\r\n###Idle tracking\r\nThe bot will watch how much time you spend idle and you will level up the more time you spend idle.  Players of [IdleRPG](http://idlerpg.net/) will recognize this but the big difference is that there is no penalty for actually participating in the channel.\r\n\r\nYou can set your player's class by using the Brain.\r\n\r\n* botname set idler_class [whatever you want]\r\n\r\nYou can also see the top idle players.\r\n\r\n* botname idlers\r\n\r\n###ASCII Art\r\nThe bot can emit ASCII art to the channel or provide a list of available art.\r\n\r\n* botname: ascii [art]\r\n* botname: ascii list\r\n\r\n###Impersonation Commands\r\nHave the bot pull a quote from various people out of it's brain\r\n* botname: be [name]\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of names that are valid, try archer!\r\n\r\n###Debian Bugs\r\nSaying 'debbugs [bug number]' anywhere in a channel with the bot will cause it to emit information on that bug.\r\n\r\n###Sending SMS\r\nThis can take advantage of the 'mobile' variable stored in the Brain, so if you want to get SMS messages from the bot make sure you ''set mobile [yourphonenumber]''.  The format '+12125551234' is suggested.\r\n* botname: sms [nickname or phone number] [message]\r\n\r\n###URL Tracking\r\nUrls sent to the channel are caught, tracked and shortened for easy copy/pasting.\r\n\r\n###Surprises!\r\nThere are a few other easter eggs, using the bot is the best way to find out what fun could be hidden!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
