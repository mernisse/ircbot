IRCBot WebSocket API

Request Format:
{
	"request": String [required],
	"target": String [depends on request],
	"message": String [depends on request]
}

Response Format:
{
	"status": "ok" or "error",
	"message": Object [depending on request]
}


Events:

actions
-------
Any actions (/me does something) will be sent in the following format:

{
	"source": [channel],
	"nick": [nick of sender],
	"message": [the text of the action as sent],
	"type": "action"
}

As an example if Ford_Prefect in #python types "/me yawns" into their
IRC client, the resultant message sent by the bot would be:

{
	"source": "#python",
	"nick": "Ford_Prefect",
	"message": "yawns",
	"type": "action"
}

privmsg
-------
Upon reciept of either directed speech (nickname_of_bot: message) or a
direct privmsg to the bot (/msg nickname_of_bot message) or any text
to a monitored channel starting with a '!' the bot will emit an event
in the following format.

{
	"source": [nick or channel],
	"nick": [nick of sender],
	"message": [the text of the message with the nickname: stripped],
	"type": "privmsg"
}

For example a public message in #python to the bot with a name of marvin
from user Ford_Prefect would generate (eg: marvin: Where is my towel?)

{
	"source": "#python",
	"nick": "Ford_Prefect",
	"message": "Where is my towel?",
	"type": "privmsg"
}

A ! prefixed message will look like

{
	"source": "#python",
	"nick": "Ford_Prefect",
	"message": "!use Electronic Sub-Etha Auto Hitching Thumb",
	"type": "privmsg"
}

A private message to the bot's nick will be
{
	"source": "Ford_Prefect",
	"nick": "Ford_Prefect",
	"message": "Hang on, Marvin.  We're coming to get you.",
	"type": "privmsg"
}

pubmsg
-------
Any other speech in a channel that is not from the bot or detected as
a privmsg (as described above) will be emitted as a pubmsg in the following
format.

{
	"source": [channel],
	"nick": [nick of sender],
	"message": [the text of the message],
	"type": "pubmsg"
}

joins/parts
-----------
When a user joins or parts the channel the following event will be sent.

{
	"source": [channel name],
	"nick": [nick],
	"type": "join" or "part"
}
